# wpkit, A WP Toolkit for Django

Companion Django project and db for testing in the wp_kit_test repository.

The code is working but still incomplete, I need to get authorization from my new employer to continue working on this in my spare time, then finish porting code from the previous version, messy but fully working as I've been using it for years for all my blogs. Stay tuned.
